# Badge Generation Rules for Agent Trust Application

## Global Goals

- Output should feel like gamification achievement badges, not "UI icons."
- Must be instantly readable at small sizes (16–24px), and look great at 64–128px.
- Style must be original (no copying existing badge art).

## Badge Structure (Mandatory)

Every badge uses the same 3-layer anatomy:

### Outer Ring (Category Ring)
- Thick ring (≈ 12–18% of badge diameter)
- Solid fill, high saturation
- Optional subtle inner stroke to add "enamel edge"

### Inner Field (Scene Backdrop)
- Flat fill, slightly lighter/darker than ring
- Optional subtle texture (very low contrast): stripes, radial rays, grid, brackets
- No busy patterns

### Primary Emblem (Hero Symbol)
- Single bold silhouette
- Large (≈ 45–60% of badge diameter)
- No thin lines, no tiny details
- 1–2 colors max

### Validation Mark (Integrated)
- A checkmark that is integrated (stamp, inset, or corner notch), not floating randomly
- Should read as "verified" even without color

## Category Conventions

Validation badges all share the same "family look": circular medal + thick ring + integrated checkmark.

Reserve associations for later by switching color family or ring treatment (don't mix now).

## Color Rules (Locked Palette)

Use these exact hex values unless you're intentionally creating tier variants.

### Name Validation (Blue)
- Ring: `#2563EB`
- Field: `#60A5FA`

### Account Validation (Cyan/Teal)
- Ring: `#06B6D4`
- Field: `#67E8F9`

### App Validation (Indigo/Violet)
- Ring: `#6366F1`
- Field: `#A5B4FC`

### Neutrals
- Emblem primary (light): `#FFFFFF`
- Emblem secondary (dark): `#0F172A`
- Accent stroke: `rgba(255,255,255,0.35)` or `rgba(15,23,42,0.2)`

## Texture Rules (Subtle Only)

Textures must be barely visible (5–10% contrast) and must match the badge meaning:

- **Name**: horizontal stripes / faint "text lines"
- **Account**: radial rays / concentric permission ring
- **App**: subtle grid / corner brackets (container/runtime vibe)

## Emblem Semantics (What Each MUST Contain)

### Name Validation
- **Emblem**: bold nameplate / tag / banner
- **Integrated check**: embedded in plate corner or wax-stamp overlay

### Account Validation
- **Emblem**: bold key + optional "control ring" behind it
- **Integrated check**: small inset in the ring or key bow

### App Validation
- **Emblem**: bold module/cube/app tile + subtle container cue (brackets/frame)
- **Integrated check**: corner notch or stamp on tile

## Line + Shape Constraints

- Minimum stroke thickness (if using strokes): ≥ 2px at 64px artboard (scale accordingly)
- Prefer filled shapes over outlines.
- No text inside badges.
- No gradients unless extremely subtle (if used: single linear gradient only, not glossy).

## Output Requirements

Generate:
- **SVG** (primary source of truth)
- Optional PNG exports at: 16, 24, 32, 64, 128, 256
- Transparent background
- Artboard: 512x512 for source SVG
- Safe margin: keep emblem inside 80% of diameter

## File Naming

- `badge-validation-name.svg`
- `badge-validation-account.svg`
- `badge-validation-app.svg`

## Cursor Prompts

### Prompt A — Create the SVGs (Best "One Shot")

Use this in Cursor Chat:

```
Create 3 original gamified achievement badge SVGs (512x512, transparent background) following this style system:

STYLE:
- Circular medal badge with thick outer ring + inner field + single bold emblem + integrated checkmark stamp.
- High contrast, collectible "achievement" feel (EpicMix-like concept), but 100% original art.
- Flat fills, minimal strokes, no text, no busy detail, readable at 24px.
- Use subtle low-contrast textures in the inner field (5–10% contrast).

COLORS (locked):
- Name Validation: ring #2563EB, field #60A5FA
- Account Validation: ring #06B6D4, field #67E8F9
- App Validation: ring #6366F1, field #A5B4FC
Neutrals: emblem white #FFFFFF with small dark accents #0F172A if needed.

EMBLEMS (must be obvious):
1) Name Validation: a bold nameplate/tag/banner as the hero symbol, with integrated checkmark stamp embedded into the plate.
   Inner field texture: faint horizontal "text lines".
2) Account Validation: a bold key as the hero symbol, optionally with a control ring behind it, with integrated checkmark inset into the ring or key head.
   Inner field texture: subtle radial rays or concentric rings.
3) App Validation: a bold cube/module/app tile as the hero symbol, with subtle container brackets/frame, with integrated checkmark as a corner notch or stamp on the tile.
   Inner field texture: subtle grid or bracket motif.

DELIVERABLES:
- Provide three separate SVG files:
  - badge-validation-name.svg
  - badge-validation-account.svg
  - badge-validation-app.svg
No external assets. Use simple <path>, <circle>, <rect>. Keep shapes clean and scalable.
```

### Prompt B — Improve Readability at Small Sizes (Iteration Loop)

```
Review these three SVG badges for legibility at 24px and 16px. Simplify any shapes that will blur when scaled down. Ensure:
- One dominant emblem silhouette
- Checkmark remains readable
- Textures remain subtle and do not create noise
Output updated SVGs with the same filenames.
```

### Prompt C — Add Tier Variants (Optional, Future)

```
Create tier variants for each badge: bronze, silver, gold. Keep the inner field and emblem identical; only modify the OUTER RING with metallic-like flat colors (no glossy gradients) and add a small top star notch for gold only. Output 9 SVGs named badge-validation-<type>-<tier>.svg.
```

## Practical Cursor Workflow

1. Create folder: `apps/admin/public/badges/`
2. Add this doc: `.cursor/rules/badge-generation.mdc` (this file)
3. Ask Cursor using Prompt A to generate the three SVG files.
4. Use Prompt B if any emblem doesn't read at 24px.
5. Export PNGs via your build pipeline (SVGO + sharp) later.
